### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software development student at Codespace Academy, where I am acquiring skills in Front-end dvelopment.
My passion lies in problem-solving, particularly in the domains of infrastructure, spatial planning, and food security. I aspire to leverage this experience as a stepping stone into the realm of data science, a field that I believe offers the opportunity to make a significant impact on developmental challenges.

### My projects:
